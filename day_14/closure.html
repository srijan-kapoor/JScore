	// ## Closure exercises

	// 1. Write a function, `nonsense` that takes an input `string`. This function contains another function, `blab` which alerts `string` and is immediately called inside the function `nonsense`. `blab` should look like this inside of the `nonsense` function:

	// 1. In your function, `nonsense`, change the immediate call to a setTimeout so that the call to `blab` comes after 2 seconds. The `blab` function itself should stay the same as before.

	function nonsense(string){
	var blab =function(){
		alert(string);
    }
	setTimeout(blab,5000)
    }

 // 1. Now, instead of calling `blab` inside of `nonsense`, return `blab` (without invoking it). Call `nonsense` with some string and store the returned value (the `blab` function) in a variable called `blabLater`. Call `nonsense` again with a different string and store the returned value in a variable called `blabAgainLater`.

 function nonsense(string){
	var blab =function(){
		alert(string);
    }
	return blab;
    }

  var blabLater = nonsense('yolo');
  var blabAgainLater = nonsense('head')

  // 1. Inspect `blabLater` and `blabAgainLater` in your console. Call them (they are functions!) and see what happens!

  blabLater();
  blabAgainLater();

  // 1. Write a function with a closure. The first function should only take one argument, someone's first name, and the inner function should take one more argument, someone's last name. The inner function should console.log both the first name and the last name.

	var test = function firstFunc(firstName) {
	  	function innerFunc(secondName) {
	  		console.log(firstName+ ' ' +secondName)
	  	}	
	  	return innerFunc;
	  }

	 var test2 = test('amit');
	 test2('james');

	// 1. Create a `storyWriter` function that returns an object with two methods. One method, `addWords` adds a word to your story and returns the story while the other one, `erase`, resets the story back to an empty string. 

	var someStory = function storyWriter() {;
	var para = '';
	return {
		addwords: function(words) {
			para += words; 
			return para;
		},
		erase: function() {
			para = '';
			}
		}
	}


	// 1. Using the module pattern, design a toaster. Use your creativity here and think about what you want your users to be able to access on the outside of your toaster vs what you don't want them to be able to touch.
